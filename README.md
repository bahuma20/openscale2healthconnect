# OpenScale to Health Connect

This android app allows you to sync your data
from [OpenScale](https://github.com/oliexdev/openScale)
to the Android [Health Connect](https://health.google/health-connect-android/) framework.

** This app does currently not work because it is in review by Google and until then does not have
access to HealthConnect **

It works completely offline without any cloud dependencies or tracking. Your data stays on your
device.
